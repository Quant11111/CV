THis system use a merkle proof to verifie that a juge is a member of our juge list (added after filling a QWC in order to avoid a single persone to vote several times for the same trial). The merkle proof is frequently use to avoid storing a large array into the blockchain but still keeping a short proof able to verrifie if an element (address) was part of the array (ex: for whitelists). This way, the verrification is gaz efficient even if the list is massive",
