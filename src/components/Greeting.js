            <p>
                Holder of an engenering licence and currently taking a break before going for my master in order to grow some technical competences and aquire some experience from active life. <br/> 
                I can create ur react website and take care of the UI design if you dont already have one you want me to integrate ! <br/> 
                I guaranty an optimum user experience while navigating on your website in order to promote any service or product you want. Feel free to contact me by e-mail, phone, or using Linkedin <br/>
                
                Also i would be glad to provide (remoted if you dont live in Paris) scolar support in Math, physics, French if you're learning it as a foreign language, and can also help begginers with programming concepts. <br/>
                As a french person even if i wouldn't say im bilingual, but im quite fluent in inglish and usualy have a good contact with people. So keep in mind that tutoring is something I enjoy and I hope people also enjoy to learn with me.
