          <h3>Stage de dev onChain Sinaps</h3>
          <p>
            Here I helped a startup to build here webApp and did mostly some
            researches about how to make a dapp (decentralised app) from this
            app. This is for this project that I built my first smart contracts
            and I realy got hoocked by the infinite blockchain usecases that
            came across my head at this time. In the end, I kept learning
            Solidity after this internship.
